# Loopify: Doubly Linked Playlist"

Loopify is a music playlist implemented with a non-circular doubly linked list. 
The playlist supports adding/removign songs, forward and backward traversal, and looping playback (when you reach the end, playNext wraps back to the beginning.) A shuffle mode randomizes the playback order.
